> Unofficial Python wrapper for the unite-db.com REST API.

## Introduction

[`unite-db`](https://unite-db.com/) is a website dedicated to maintaining a database on various stats in the game Pokemon Unite including stats for Pokemon, Battle Items and Held Items.

This wrapper provides a simple, Pythonic interface to those stats via a REST API, with automatic result caching.

Please be warned that this is an unofficial wrapper and the REST API is a private one, so please do not abuse it.

If you are publishing any of the data collected with this API, please give credit to [`unite-db`](https://unite-db.com/). They spend many hours collecting this data.

### Installation

The package is installable via `pip`.

```sh
pip install py-unite-db
```

### Usage

Import the `UniteDb` object:

```python
from py_unite_db import UniteDb

unite_db = UniteDb()
```

Let's get the names of all supporter Pokemon:

```python
>>> [pokemon.name for pokemon in unite_db.pokemon if pokemon.role == "Supporter"]
['Blissey', 'Eldegoss', 'Mr.Mime', 'Wigglytuff']
```

```

### Type Checking

The project must pass [`mypy`](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) type checking.

```sh
$ pdm run typecheck
```

If you are using `mypy` with an IDE like VS Code make sure you have run

```sh
$ pdm run stubs
```

To work around `mypy` not supporting PEP582 yet. See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10633 for more info on this.

### Formatting

Imports are sorted with [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) and source files are formatted with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black).

```sh
$ pdm run format
$ pdm run formatcheck
```

If you are using VS Code this will be automatically done on save.
